This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: forgetting to install necessary packages for testing. The `bug.Dockerfile` is missing the `unittest` module, which leads to failure when running tests. The solution, `solution.Dockerfile`, corrects the issue by adding the required python3-pip package and explicitly installing the 'unittest' library if needed.  This highlights the importance of specifying all runtime dependencies within the Dockerfile.
